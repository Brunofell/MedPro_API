# MEDPRO - API  

This is the advanced API for the **MEDPRO** project, a platform dedicated to managing medical records. The API was developed using **Java Spring Boot** with integration to a **PostgreSQL** database, offering security through JWT authentication and complete documentation via Swagger.  

During development, the API was temporarily hosted on AWS for production environment validation. However, we decided to discontinue hosting to focus on other aspects of the project and optimize resource usage.  

## Features  

- **JWT Authentication:** Advanced security to protect sensitive medical/patient data.  
- **Medical Records Management:** Full CRUD operations for managing medical records.  
- **Patient and Doctor Management:** Functions to handle patient and doctor information.  
- **Swagger UI:** Interactive API documentation.  
- **PostgreSQL:** Database for secure and persistent storage.  
- **Full CRUD for Doctors, Patients, and Appointments**
